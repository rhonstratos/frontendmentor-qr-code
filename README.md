## My process

### Built with 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework 
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework  

### What I learned

This is my first take on how to create a simple component using the reactjs and nextjs. I just copied the template design without further customizing.  

### Continued development

In the future, I want to learn more techniques and design patterns to create a more lively UI/UX.
